Timetable checker for CityU mates. It reads class information from AIMS and match against your timetable to see if time conflits with sessions occurs.

**This extension is for CityU students only, and only works when you are using [AIMS](https://banweb.cityu.edu.hk/).**

## Browser Support

This is a Chromium-based-browser extension that can be installed on the latest desktop versions of Google Chrome, Vivaldi and Microsoft Edge. (Other Chromium-based browsers may be used, but we do not guarantee it works)

## How it works

This extension will read your class schedule when you go to Course Registration &gt; Main Menu for Web Add/Drop &gt; My Detail Schedule.

Then, when you browse the Master Class Schedule and check sections provided by a particular course, you can find out whether conflicts with the section and you current schedule occurs.

The extension will append 3 cells to each row of the table, showing the status and available actions. (Example below)

This extension also provides a wishlist function for you to save the CRNs of the courses you want to register. It can also auto-fill the CRNs in the wishlist to the Add Classes Worksheet in the add/drop interface. (You still need to click "Submit changes" button **manually** to apply changes)
